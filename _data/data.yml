    # - title: "On Policy Generalization in Deep Neuroevolution"
    #   link: #TBD
    #   code: "https://github.com/TemplierPaul/BERL"
    #   authors: Paul Templier, Emmanuel Rachelson, Dennis G. Wilson
    #   conference: GECCO 2022 - Evolutionary RL Workshop
    #   date: 2022-06-01
    #   blog: #
    #   excerpt: Evolution Strategies have been used as an efficient tool for policy optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning, but their process relying on the score over one episode makes them sensitive to changes in the fitness environment. We compare two ES algorithms on Procgen, a recent benchmark that uses procedurally-generated environments to test for generalization, and discuss their shortcomings.

    # - title: "LUCIE: An Evaluation and Selection Method for Stochastic Problems"
    #   link: #TBD
    #   code: "https://github.com/TemplierPaul/pyUCEA"
    #   authors: Erwan Lecarpentier, Paul Templier, Emmanuel Rachelson, Dennis G. Wilson
    #   conference: GECCO 2022 (Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference)
    #   date: 2022-06-01
    #   blog: #
    #   excerpt: Selection in genetic algorithms is difficult for stochastic problems due to noise in the fitness space. Common methods to deal with this fitness noise include sampling multiple fitness values, which can be expensive. We propose LUCIE, the Lower Upper Confidence Intervals Elitism method, which selects individuals based on confi- dence. By focusing evaluation on separating promising individuals from others, we demonstrate that LUCIE can be effectively used as an elitism mechanism in genetic algorithms. We provide a the- oretical analysis on the convergence of LUCIE and demonstrate its ability to select fit individuals across multiple types of noise on the OneMax and LeadingOnes problems. We also evaluate LUCIE as a selection method for neuroevolution on control policies with stochastic fitness values.

    - title: A Geometric Encoding for Neural Network Evolution
      link: "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449639.3459361"
      code: "https://github.com/TemplierPaul/GENE.jl"
      authors: Paul Templier, Emmanuel Rachelson, Dennis G. Wilson
      conference: GECCO 2021 (Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference)
      date: 2021-06-01
      blog: #
      excerpt: A major limitation to the optimization of artificial neural networks (ANN) with evolutionary methods lies in the high dimensionality of the search space, the number of weights growing quadratically with the size of the network. This leads to expensive training costs, especially in evolution strategies which rely on matrices whose sizes grow with the number of genes. We introduce a geometric encoding for neural network evolution (GENE) as a representation of ANN parameters in a smaller space that scales linearly with the number of neurons, allowing for efficient parameter search. Each neuron of the network is encoded as a point in a latent space and the weight of a connection between two neurons is computed as the distance between them. The coordinates of all neurons are then optimized with evolution strategies in a reduced search space while not limiting network fitness and possibly improving search.

    - title: "Evolving a Dota 2 bot: Illuminating search in CGP and NEAT"
      link: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d9w/DotaBot/master/article.pdf"
      code: "https://github.com/d9w/DotaBot"
      authors: Paul Templier, Lucas Hervier, Dennis G. Wilson
      conference: Competition at GECCO 2020
      date: 2020-06-01
      blog: #
      excerpt: In this work we present an evolution-based approach applied to Dota 2 in the Project Breezy challenge. The goal of this project is to train an agent to play a 1v1 Midlane match against the game's bots of varrying difficulties, with both sides playing Shadow Fiend. The approach we implemented relies on the MAP-elites algorithm assisted with a neural-based simulator of the game to increase behavior diversity and reduce computation load, using CGP agents or NEAT networks as individuals.
